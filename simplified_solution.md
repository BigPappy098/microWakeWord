# Simplified Solution for microWakeWord Training Notebook

I've analyzed the issue and found a simpler solution. The basic notebook uses a much more straightforward approach to run the model training, which is more reliable and easier to maintain.

## The Problem

The easy training notebook is trying to import a `main` function from `microwakeword.model_train_eval`, but there is no such function in that module. Instead, the module is designed to be run as a script with command-line arguments.

## The Solution

Replace the complex code that tries to import and call functions from the module directly with a simpler approach that runs the module as a subprocess, similar to how the basic notebook does it.

Here's the code that should replace the current implementation in the `run_training()` function:

```python
def run_training():
    try:
        with output_text:
            print("Starting training...")
            
            # Build the command
            cmd = [
                "python", "-m", "microwakeword.model_train_eval",
                f"--training_config=training_parameters.yaml",
                "--train", "1",
                "--restore_checkpoint", "1",
                "--test_tf_nonstreaming", "0",
                "--test_tflite_nonstreaming", "0",
                "--test_tflite_nonstreaming_quantized", "0",
                "--test_tflite_streaming", "0",
                "--test_tflite_streaming_quantized", "1",
                "--use_weights", "best_weights",
                "mixednet",
                f"--pointwise_filters", pointwise_filters,
                f"--repeat_in_block", "1,1,1,1",
                f"--mixconv_kernel_sizes", kernel_sizes,
                f"--residual_connection", "0,0,0,0",
                f"--first_conv_filters", str(first_conv_filters),
                f"--first_conv_kernel_size", "5",
                f"--stride", "3"
            ]
            
            # Run the command and capture output
            process = subprocess.Popen(
                cmd,
                stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                stderr=subprocess.STDOUT,
                text=True,
                bufsize=1
            )
            
            # Print output in real-time
            for line in process.stdout:
                print(line.strip())
                # Update progress bar based on output
                if "Step #" in line and "accuracy" in line:
                    try:
                        step_num = int(line.split("Step #")[1].split(":")[0].strip())
                        progress = min(100, int(step_num * 100 / training_steps_slider.value))
                        progress_bar.value = progress
                    except:
                        pass
            
            # Wait for process to complete
            process.wait()
            
            if process.returncode == 0:
                print("Training completed successfully!")
                progress_bar.value = 100
                progress_bar.bar_style = 'success'
            else:
                print(f"Training failed with return code {process.returncode}")
                progress_bar.bar_style = 'danger'
    except Exception as e:
        with output_text:
            print(f"Error during training: {str(e)}")
            import traceback
            print(traceback.format_exc())
            progress_bar.bar_style = 'danger'
```

Also, replace the import statement:

```python
# Import necessary modules
import subprocess
import sys
```

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simplicity**: This approach is much simpler and more reliable than trying to import and call functions from the module directly.

2. **Consistency**: It's consistent with how the basic notebook runs the training process.

3. **Isolation**: Running the training in a separate process provides better isolation and prevents issues with the notebook's environment.

4. **Real-time Feedback**: The output is captured and displayed in real-time, providing better feedback to the user.

5. **Progress Tracking**: The progress bar is updated based on the output, giving the user a better sense of how the training is progressing.

## Implementation

To implement this solution, you need to:

1. Replace the import statement with `import subprocess`
2. Replace the `run_training()` function with the code above
3. Keep the rest of the notebook as is

This approach will make the notebook more reliable and easier to maintain, while still providing the interactive and visual experience that the easy notebook aims to provide.
